Repeatable load and request based testing for your web server.

I need to collect metrics related to response time, status codes, and other data over time. I need to be able to report on this data. Current tools would allow for some of this, but aren't quite as easy to roll into a testing framework. Plus, when your data comes back you might want to be able to scream about it, for instance, if some metrics start showing a 50% increase in response time.

This tool aims to fill those needs.


Usage
=====

You can do it one of two ways. You can either run your tests on the CLI or you can run them through the API.

TODO: outline these details.
